# islandora-jexcel-scratchpad
 Exploring using jExcel as a bulk metadata editor for Islandora 8.

## Proofs of Concept:

- [Spreadsheet](spreadsheet.html) - The initial proof of concept exploring spreadsheet options.
- [Import CSV](papaparse.html) - Explores loading from a spreadsheet. (Still a lot to do here; could use an Excel-like import wizard to work really well.)
- [Load files](filedrag.html) - Explores populating a spreadsheet from a list of files on the user's computer. (Works best on Chrome; waiting for the Electron app skeleton.)
- [Load from Drupal Content Type](load_content_type.html) - Explores building an empty spreadsheet based on the entity's form display. (Assumes JSON:API is enabled on a site located at localhost:8000.)
