    <h1>Testing <a href="https://bossanova.uk/jexcel/v3/">jExcel</a> for <a href="https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench">Islandora Workbench</a></h1>

    <h2>The Spreadsheet</h2>

    <div id="spreadsheet"></div>
    <script>loadData('http://localhost:8000/jexceldata');</script>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Currently assumes you have an Islandora instance accessible at <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost:8000</a> that has JSON:API and CORS (see below) enabled with some existing <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/controlled_access_terms">Controlled Access Terms</a> populated.
    </p>

    <p>Assumes both the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/csv_serialization">csv_serialization</a>
      and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/image_base64_formatter">image_base64_formatter</a>
      modules are installed on your Drupal site with  <a href="views.view.test.yml">a REST-based view exposed as a CSV file</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Only partially works right now.</strong> I can get the thumbnail and field types to work<del> but column titles only work by setting csvHeaders to false and then deleting the first line</del>. <ins></a href="https://github.com/paulhodel/jexcel/pull/441">Column titles now work</a>.</ins> The CSV csv_serialization module uses a quoted string with comma delimiters for multi-valued columns rather than the semi-colons used by jExcel. I haven't found a simple way to convince either of them to change their behavior on this point without PRs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially my browser refused to load the dropdown boxes from Drupal due to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>.
      A bit of searching lead me to <a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/245903/how-do-i-set-up-cors">a forum post</a>
      indicating that I needed to configure my site's services.yml to enable CORS.
      There may be a way to do it without this, but it is what I have right now.
