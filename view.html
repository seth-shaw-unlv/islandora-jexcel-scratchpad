    <h1>Testing <a href="https://bossanova.uk/jexcel/v3/">jExcel</a> for <a href="https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench">Islandora Workbench</a></h1>

    <h2>The Spreadsheet</h2>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Currently assumes you have an Islandora instance accessible at <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost:8000</a> that has JSON:API and CORS (see below) enabled with some existing <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/controlled_access_terms">Controlled Access Terms</a> populated.
    </p>

    <p>Assumes <del>both the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/csv_serialization">csv_serialization</a>
      and</del> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/image_base64_formatter">image_base64_formatter</a>
      module<del>s are</del><ins>is</ins> installed on your Drupal site with
      <a href="views.view.test.yml">a REST-based view exposed as <del>a CSV file</del> <ins>json</ins></a>.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Only partially works right now.</strong> I can get the thumbnail and field types to work<del> but column titles only work by setting csvHeaders to false and then deleting the first line</del>. <ins></a href="https://github.com/paulhodel/jexcel/pull/441">Column titles now work</a>.</ins> <del>The CSV csv_serialization module uses a quoted string with comma delimiters for multi-valued columns rather than the semi-colons used by jExcel. I haven't found a simple way to convince either of them to change their behavior on this point without PRs.</del><ins>The csv_serialization module wasn't working well with multi-valued cells (and it has gotten very little support over the past year) so I decided to simply parse the response json into the jExcel data structure myself. However, it currently assumes all the results in a single request; I need to explore using jExcel's lazy loading to see if I can pre-process additional pages and implement the pagination (using the "full pager" setting; simply add "?page=n" where n is an incrementor with zero-index counting).</ins>
    </p>
    
    <p><del>Oddly, dropdowns and autocompletes are not displaying their values on table load. If I double-click the field they appear and using the fill handle will copy their values.</del>
      <ins>Fixed:</ins>
      <a href="autocomplete_quirk.html">Testing</a> indicated that any dropdown/autocomplete values that don't exist in the source array at render time won't show up (which makes sense).
      Simply adding values to the source array won't trigger re-renders. I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/paulhodel/jexcel/issues/454">ticket about triggering re-renders</a>
      and the advice boiled down to "don't render the table until the dropdowns populate".
      (I still think there should be an easy way to trigger re-renders...)
      So, now the updateDropdown function returns an array of promises that I can gather up and wait until they all complete before the table render happens. 
      I've added a spinner in case this takes a long time but my tests have been too quick for it to display.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially my browser refused to load the dropdown boxes from Drupal due to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>.
      A bit of searching lead me to <a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/245903/how-do-i-set-up-cors">a forum post</a>
      indicating that I needed to configure my site's services.yml to enable CORS.
      There may be a way to do it without this, but it is what I have right now.
